### About the VAST Challenge

The Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge is an annual contest with the goal of advancing the field of visual analytics through competition. The VAST Challenge is designed to help researchers understand how their software would be used in a novel analytic task and determine if their data transformations, visualizations, and interactions would be beneficial for particular analytic tasks. VAST Challenge problems provide researchers with realistic tasks and data sets for evaluating their software, as well as an opportunity to advance the field by solving more complex problems.

Researchers and software providers have repeatedly used the data sets from throughout the life of the VAST Challenge as benchmarks to demonstrate and test the capabilities of their systems. The ground truth embedded in the data sets has helped researchers evaluate and strengthen the utility of their visualizations.

The VAST Challenge 2018 presents three mini-challenges for you to apply your visual analytics research and technologies to help a continuing troublesome state of affairs in a wildlife preserve.

These challenges are open to participation by individuals and teams in industry, government, and academia. We encourage your submissions and look forward to seeing your innovative approaches to solving these challenges using visual analytics.

### The challenge :

Claims that the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit are healthy and vibrant across the whole preserve are a key component of Kasios' position against the work done by grad student Mitch from last year. Other data sources are needed to further investigate the birds' situation. Perhaps these bird call recordings could provide more insight into the real situation? Blending machine learning and visual analytics may be a powerful combination for this mini-challenge.
